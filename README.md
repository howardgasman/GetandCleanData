## Getting and Cleaning Data
===============

### Instructions of code in run_analysis.R

The code has been been done in various steps, which are as per the course instructions.

### PRE-CODE

* First, the "plyr" library is initialised, as this will be used later in the code

### STEP 1: Merge the training and tests datasets

1) This step reads in the following source files into variables of the same name:
*X_train
*X_test

2) These 2 dataframes are then merged into dataframe "X" using rbind.


### STEP 2: Extract the measurements for the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

1) The "features" source file is read into a dataset of the same name.
2) Dataset "X" is give column names as per the "features" dataset



### STEP 3


### STEP 4
